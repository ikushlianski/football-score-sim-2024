## Create new Nest.js microservice

Use Nx plugins so you can generate new apps and libs easily.

1. Ensure you have `nx` installed globally: `npm install -g nx`
2. Run `nx g @nx/nest:app <microservice-name>` to create a new microservice
3. Switch to SWC compiler by following the instructions [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/swc). See how SWC is configured in the existing microservices for reference.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

Common command pattern:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

For example, you can test your new microservice by running `nx test <microservice-name>` from the project root.

To start the microservice

```nx serve <microservice-name>```


You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

...or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
